Textile markup language support for OCaml
========================================

Features :
----------

* currently it supports most of textile syntax
* translating textile to an AST
* translating the AST to XHTML
* translating the AST to OCamlduce's XHTML (ocsigen support)
* 'itextile' command which takes textile and returns XHTMl
* 'itextile_duce' - the same but maked with OCamlduce

Building :
----------

First you need to get
* an OCaml compiler >= 3.11 (http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml);
* GNU Make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/);
* findlib which provide ocamlfind command
  (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html);
* extlib for OCaml (http://www.cduce.org/ocaml.html)

Optionaly (for OCamlduce support):
* OCamlduce - modified OCaml compiler (http://www.cduce.org/ocaml.html)
* ocsigen webserver - only for its libs, so you don't need to
  launch it (http://ocsigen.org/)

Then run:

$ make

If you need api docs then run:

$ make doc

And watch the doc/ directory.

You can also compile itextile utility:

$ make itextile

And test it:

$ echo 'h1. Hello *world*!' | ./itextile
<h1>Hello <strong>world</strong>!</h1>

Installation :
--------------

$ sudo make install

Another branch
--------------

The previous code looks too imperative and ugly for me, so I've tried
to rewrite it with functional streams and parsers from camlp5. But it becomes
tens times slower because Fstream.of_channel and other fstream/fparser things.
Anyway, you can find this branch here:

* darcs get http://komar.bitcheese.net/darcs/textile-fstream/

I will be happy if you'll help me with that or simply show me a good combinator library.
